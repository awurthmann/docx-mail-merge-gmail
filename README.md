## ðŸ’¡ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/awurthmann/docx-mail-merge-gmail.git
cd docx-mail-merge-gmail
```

### 2. Set Up App Password (Gmail)
1. Go to [https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
2. Make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled on your Google account
3. Choose **App: Mail** and **Device: Other (e.g., MyComputer)**
4. Copy the 16-character app password

### 3. Configure Your Settings
Edit `config.py` and set:
```python
YOUR_EMAIL = 'your-email@gmail.com'
APP_PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'
EMAIL_SUBJECT = 'Your email subject here'
DOCX_PATH = 'email_template.docx'
CSV_PATH = 'recipients.csv'
```
We are using a config.py vs an .env file here for "reasons" so be sure to keep this password safe and only run this script on a secured system. In fact, you should consider disabling or chaning the app password after each use. 

### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Script
```bash
python send_mail_merge_smtp.py
```
